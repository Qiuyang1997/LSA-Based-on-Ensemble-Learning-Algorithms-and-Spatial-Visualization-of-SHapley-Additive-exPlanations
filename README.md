First of all, if you run into any problems using this code for scientific research, first check that your files are named and saved in a canonical format (including but not limited to uniform resolution and coordinate systems), and then check that your python environment is configured correctly. Finally, you can contact me: Dr. Yang Qiu （邱洋, Shcool of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China) :qiuyang19970819@163.com or qiuyang@cug.edu.cn.

If you use this code (or modify it to use it) to publish an article, patent, monograph, or other work, please cite my paper (under update). I would really appreciate it!

I welcome all forms of academic cooperation. My main research interests include: water resources management, environmental management, territorial space regulation, isotope hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry, groundwater pollution and management, geological hazard assessment and managemen and Various applications of MLs in the environmental field...
# LSA-Based-on-Ensemble-Learning-Algorithms-and-Spatial-Visualization-of-SHapley-Additive-exPlanations
Here, we employed four commonly used ensemble learning algorithms, including RF, GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to assess landslide susceptibility in Chengde City, which is a region prone to landslides and transitions from North China into Northeast China . To address these deficiencies mentioned above, we utilized the SHAP method for analyzing multiple geoenvironmental factors’ impacts on landslide susceptibility while offering a novel visualization approach for interpreting SHAP results within the geographic information system (GIS) environment.![流程图](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ad803f9-1e62-4c2c-ae7e-02555e8324a2)

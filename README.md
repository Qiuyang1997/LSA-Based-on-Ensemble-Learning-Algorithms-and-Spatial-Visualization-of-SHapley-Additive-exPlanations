# LSA-Based-on-Ensemble-Learning-Algorithms-and-Spatial-Visualization-of-SHapley-Additive-exPlanations
Here, we employed four commonly used ensemble learning algorithms, including RF, GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to assess landslide susceptibility in Chengde City, which is a region prone to landslides and transitions from North China into Northeast China . To address these deficiencies mentioned above, we utilized the SHAP method for analyzing multiple geoenvironmental factors’ impacts on landslide susceptibility while offering a novel visualization approach for interpreting SHAP results within the geographic information system (GIS) environment.![流程图](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ad803f9-1e62-4c2c-ae7e-02555e8324a2)
